# NXcanSAS_examples
example data files written to the NXcanSAS standard

## NXcanSAS: a NeXus contributed definition
In NeXus, *contributed definitions* are in an *incubation*
status, during which review and revision occur by both the
proposal team and members of the NIAC.  The process to **ratify** the
NXcanSAS will move it to become one of the NeXus *application definitions*
so that it becomes a permanent part of the NeXus standard.

The proposal is registered as an issue for the upcoming NIAC meeting.
See the issue here: "ratify NXcanSAS as application definition" at
https://github.com/nexusformat/NIAC/issues/7

The process to *ratify* is in item 3 of the NeXus Constitution:

## Recommendation
It is recommended that any NXcanSAS example data file deposited here
be checked using a validation tool called 
**punx** (Python Utilities for NeXus).
It would be useful to post the validation output from punx along with the example data file.

Information about punx (currently in development) is available online: http://punx.readthedocs.io
