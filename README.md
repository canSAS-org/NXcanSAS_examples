# NXcanSAS_examples
example data files written to the NXcanSAS standard

## Receommendation
It is recommended that any NXcanSAS example data file deposited here
be checked using a validation tool called 
**punx** (Python Utilities for NeXus).
It would be useful to post the validation output from punx along with the example data file.

Information about punx (currently in development) is available online: http://punx.readthedocs.io
